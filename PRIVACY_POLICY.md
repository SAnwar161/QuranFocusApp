# Privacy Policy for QuranFocus

**Effective Date:** December 11, 2025

**QuranFocus: Remembrance & Peace** ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application (the "App") handles your information.

## 1. Information Collection and Use

**We do not collect, store, or share any personal information.**

*   **No Personal Data:** We do not require you to create an account, log in, or provide your name, email address, or phone number.
*   **No Tracking:** We do not track your location, device usage, or other behavioral data for advertising purposes.
*   **Local Storage:** The App stores your preferences (e.g., translation settings, last read Ayat) and usage statistics (e.g., minutes focused, Ayats read) locally on your device using your phone's internal storage (`AsyncStorage`). This data never leaves your device and is deleted if you uninstall the App.

## 2. Third-Party Services

The App interacts with the following third-party services to function:

*   **AlQuran Cloud API:** We use this public API to fetch Quranic text, translations, and audio. Your IP address may be visible to this service provider as part of standard internet communication protocols when you fetch new data.
*   **External Links (Tafsir):** The App contains links to third-party websites (e.g., Quran.com) for detailed Tafsir. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these external sites.
*   **Social Sharing:** If you choose to share an Ayat card, the App invokes your device's native sharing menu. You control which app (e.g., WhatsApp, Facebook) you share the content with. We do not have access to your social media accounts or the messages you send.

## 3. Permissions

The App may request the following permissions to function:

*   **Network Access:** Required to fetch Quran data and audio from the internet.
*   **Storage/Media:** Required temporarily if you choose to generate and share an image of an Ayat card.

## 4. Children’s Privacy

Our App does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13.
